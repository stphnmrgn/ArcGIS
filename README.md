# ArcGIS
Various old python scripts (standalone and toolbox) that utilize Esri's arcpy module for various data quality tasks and/or batch processes. They were developed a while ago for use with ArcGIS for Desktop 10.3 and thus utilize python 2.7 (and are ugly, but I don't judge my past self).

These scripts are no longer being maintained, but might be useful for user's that have not migrated to ArcGIS Pro.
