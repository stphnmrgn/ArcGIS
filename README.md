# ArcGIS
Various python (standalone and toolbox) scripts that utilize Esri's arcpy module for various data QA/QC tasks and batch processes. They were developed for use with ArcGIS for Desktop 10.3 and thus utilize python 2.7.

These scripts are no longer being maintained, but might be useful for user's that have not migrated to ArcGIS Pro.
